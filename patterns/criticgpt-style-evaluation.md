## Problem

As AI-generated code becomes more sophisticated, it becomes increasingly difficult for human reviewers to catch subtle bugs, security issues, or quality problems. Traditional code review processes may miss issues in AI-generated code because:
- The volume of generated code can overwhelm human reviewers
- Subtle bugs may appear correct at first glance
- Security vulnerabilities may be non-obvious
- Style and best practice violations may be inconsistent

## Solution

Deploy specialized AI models trained specifically for code critique and evaluation. These models act as automated code reviewers that can:

1. **Identify bugs** that human reviewers might miss
2. **Detect security vulnerabilities** in generated code
3. **Suggest improvements** for code quality and efficiency
4. **Verify correctness** of implemented solutions
5. **Check adherence** to coding standards and best practices

The critic model works alongside code generation models, providing an additional layer of quality assurance before code reaches human review or production.

## Example

```python
class CriticGPTReviewer:
    def __init__(self, critic_model, severity_threshold=0.7):
        self.critic = critic_model
        self.severity_threshold = severity_threshold
        
    def review_code(self, code, context=None, language="python"):
        """Comprehensive code review using specialized critic model"""
        
        reviews = {
            'bugs': self.check_for_bugs(code, context, language),

            'quality': self.quality_review(code, language),

        }
        
        # Aggregate findings
        all_issues = []
        for category, findings in reviews.items():
            for issue in findings:
                issue['category'] = category
                all_issues.append(issue)
        
        # Sort by severity
        all_issues.sort(key=lambda x: x['severity'], reverse=True)
