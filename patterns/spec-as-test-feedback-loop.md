## Problem
Even in spec-first projects, implementations can drift as code evolves and the spec changes (or vice-versa). Silent divergence erodes trust.

## Solution
Generate **executable assertions** directly from the spec (e.g., unit or integration tests) and let the agent:

- Watch for any spec or code commit.  
- Auto-regenerate test suite from latest spec snapshot.  
- Run tests; if failures appear, open an *agent-authored* PR that either:
    - updates code to match spec, or
    - flags unclear spec segments for human review.

This creates a continuous feedback loop ensuring specification and implementation remain synchronized.

## Trade-offs
- **Pros:** catches drift early, keeps spec & impl in lock-step.
- **Cons:** heavy CI usage; false positives if spec wording is too loose.
