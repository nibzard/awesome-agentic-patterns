## Problem
Starting a new feature, module, or codebase often involves writing a significant amount of boilerplate or foundational code. This can be time-consuming and repetitive for developers.

## Solution
Utilize an AI agent to generate the initial structure, boilerplate code, or layout for new software components. The developer provides a high-level description of the desired feature or component, and the agent "scaffolds" out the basic files, functions, classes, and directory structures.

This allows developers to:
-   Quickly get a new part of the system started.
-   Focus on the core logic rather than repetitive setup tasks.
-   Ensure consistency in initial project structure.

The agent acts as a "kickstarter" for new development efforts.

## Example
```mermaid

    A[Developer: "Create new API endpoint for user profiles"] --> B[Agent: Generate Scaffolding]
    B --> C[/routes/user_profile.js\n/controllers/user_profile_controller.js\n/models/user_profile_model.js\n/tests/user_profile_test.js]
    C --> D[Developer: Implement Core Logic in Scaffolded Files]
```
