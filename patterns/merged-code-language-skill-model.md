## Problem

Building a **unified model** that excels both at **natural language tasks** (e.g., summarization, documentation generation) and **code generation/reasoning** typically requires a massive centralized training run. This is:

- **Compute-Intensive:** Training from scratch on both code and language corpora demands enormous resources.
- **Susceptible to Interference:** When mixing code and NL tasks in one pipeline, the model may forget earlier skills.

## Solution

Adopt a **decentralized training + model merging** approach:

**1. Train a "Language Specialist"**
- Fine-tune a base LLM on documentation generation, summarization, code comments, and general NL tasks.
- Save checkpoint `lang-specialist-ckpt.pt`.

**2. Train a "Code Specialist"**
- Independently fine-tune the same base LLM architecture on code-specific corpora: open-source repositories, coding challenge datasets, and code-comment pairs.
- Save checkpoint `code-specialist-ckpt.pt`.

**3. Weight Averaging Merge**
- Use simple arithmetic weight averaging (or Fisher-weighted averaging) to combine `lang-specialist-ckpt.pt` and `code-specialist-ckpt.pt` into `merged-agent-ckpt.pt`.
- Optionally, follow with a **short fine-tuning** on a mixed dataset (small NL+code tasks) to smooth out any conflicts.

**4. Iterative Merge Rounds**
- As new specialists (e.g., a "Python Testing Specialist" or "Security Static Analysis Specialist") become available, periodically merge them into the main agent.

## Example

```bash
# Example using Hugging Face transformer's merge tool
python merge_models.py \
  --model_a lang-specialist-ckpt.pt \
  --model_b code-specialist-ckpt.pt \
  --output merged-agent-ckpt.pt \
  --alpha 0.5
```

## How to use it

- **Architectural Consistency:** Ensure all specialist models share identical architecture (e.g., 1.8 B parameters, same number of layers).
- **Merging Tools:** Use established scripts (e.g., `transformers`' `merge_models`) or custom code that applies Fisher Information Matrix weighting when averaging to minimize interference.
- **Post-Merge Validation:** Run a **benchmark suite** covering both NL tasks (e.g., summarization, QA) and code tasks (e.g., code generation, bug fixing).

## Trade-offs

- **Pros:**
  - **Parallelism in R&D:** Teams can independently develop NL and code capabilities, then merge.
  - **Reduced Centralized Compute:** No need for a single massive GPU cluster to train both skill sets simultaneously.
- **Cons/Considerations:**
  - **Potential Performance Dilution:** Na√Øve averaging can "blur" specialist strengths if distributions conflict.
  - **Alignment Required:** All specialists must use the same base tokenizer and vocabulary to avoid mismatches.
