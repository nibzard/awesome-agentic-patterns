## Problem
When an agent rewrites its own "constitution," it may accidentally violate safety or regress on alignment objectives if changes aren't reviewed.

## Solution
Store the constitution in a **version-controlled, signed repository**:

- YAML/TOML rules live in Git.  
- Each commit is signed (e.g., Sigstore); CI runs automated policy checks.  
- Only commits signed by approved reviewers or automated tests are merged.  
- The agent can *propose* changes, but a gatekeeper merges them.

## How to use it
- Require `git commit -S` or similar.  
- Run diff-based linting to flag deletions of critical rules.  
- Expose constitution `HEAD` as read-only context in every agent episode.
