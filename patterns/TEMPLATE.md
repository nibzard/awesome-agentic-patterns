## Problem
Clearly state the problem this pattern solves. What challenge or limitation does it address? Be specific about the context where this problem occurs.

## Solution
Describe the core approach or technique this pattern uses. Include:

- Key components or roles
- How they interact
- The mechanism that solves the problem

If helpful, include a code snippet or pseudocode:

```pseudo
example_function() {
    // Show the pattern in action
}
```

For complex patterns, include a Mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Component A] --> B[Component B]
    B --> C[Result]
```
