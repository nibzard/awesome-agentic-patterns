## Problem
Traditional "prompt-as-puppeteer" workflows force humans to spell out every step, limiting scale and creativity.

## Solution
Give the agent **tools + a high-level goal** and let *it* decide the orchestration.
Humans supply guard-rails (first 10 % + last 3 %) while the agent handles the middle 87 %.

## Example (flow)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Dev->>Agent: "Refactor UploadService to async"
  Agent->>Repo: git grep "UploadService"
  Agent->>Tools: edit_file, run_tests
  Agent-->>Dev: PR with green CI
```
