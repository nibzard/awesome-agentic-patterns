## Problem
Stateless calls make agents forget prior decisions, causing repetition and shallow reasoning.

## Solution
Add a **vector-backed episodic memory store**:

1. After every episode, write a short "memory blob" (event, outcome, rationale) to the DB.  
2. On new tasks, embed the prompt, retrieve top-k similar memories, and inject as *hints* in the context.  
3. Apply TTL or decay scoring to prune stale memories.

## Trade-offs
**Pros:** richer continuity, fewer repeated mistakes.  
**Cons:** retrieval noise if memories aren't curated; storage cost.
