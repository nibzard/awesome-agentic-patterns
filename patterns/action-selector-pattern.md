## Problem
Untrusted input can hijack an agent's reasoning once tool feedback re-enters the context window, leading to arbitrary, harmful actions.

## Solution
Treat the LLM as an **"instruction decoder" only**:

- Map the user's natural-language request to a *pre-approved* action (or action template).  
- **No tool outputs are fed back** into the LLM.  
- The agent therefore cannot be influenced after selecting the action.

```pseudo
action = LLM.translate(prompt, allowlist)
execute(action)
# tool output NOT returned to LLM
```

## How to use it

Provide a hard allowlist of safe actions (API calls, SQL templates, page links).
Useful for customer-service bots, notification routers, kiosk interfaces.

## Trade-offs

* **Pros:** Near-immunity to prompt injection; trivial to audit.
* **Cons:** Limited flexibility; new capabilities require code updates.
