## Problem
Linear chain-of-thought reasoning can get stuck on complex problems, missing alternative approaches or failing to backtrack.

## Solution
Explore a search tree of intermediate "thoughts" instead of a single chain. The agent expands multiple possible steps and evaluates partial solutions before committing to a path.

```pseudo
queue = [root_problem]
while queue:
    thought = queue.pop()
    for step in expand(thought):
        score = evaluate(step)
        queue.push((score, step))
select_best(queue)
```

## How to use it
Apply when tasks benefit from exploring many potential strategiesâ€”puzzles, code generation, or planning. Use heuristics or a value function to prune unpromising branches.

## Trade-offs
* **Pros:** Covers more possibilities; improves reliability on hard tasks.
* **Cons:** Higher compute cost; needs a good scoring method to guide the search.
