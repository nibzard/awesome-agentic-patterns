## Overview

This repository uses a fully automated git-based pattern labeling system. Pattern labels (NEW and UPDATED) are determined directly from git commit history.

## Labeling Logic

### NEW Badges (🆕)

Patterns **created** within the last **7 days** receive a NEW badge.

- Based on first git commit that added the file
- Automatically expires after 7 days

### UPDATED Badges (🔄)

Patterns **created > 7 days ago** but **modified** within last **14 days** receive an UPDATED badge.

- Based on last git commit that modified the file
- Automatically expires after 14 days
- NEW takes precedence over UPDATED

## Migration from Manual System

### Before (Manual)

- Used `.new-patterns-tracker.txt` and `.updated-patterns-tracker.txt` files
- Required manual maintenance and updates
- Prone to inconsistencies and errors

### After (Git-Based)

- Uses git commit history as the source of truth
- Fully automated with zero manual maintenance
- Consistent and accurate labeling

## For Contributors

Nothing changes for contributors! The system automatically:

- Detects when you add new patterns (NEW label for 7 days)
- Detects when you modify existing patterns (UPDATED label for 14 days)
- Handles all labeling based on your git commits

Just commit your work as usual - the labeling happens automatically.

## Configuration

To adjust timeframes, edit `scripts/git_pattern_dates.py`:

```python
NEW_PATTERN_DAYS = 7      # NEW badge duration
UPDATED_PATTERN_DAYS = 14 # UPDATED badge duration
```

## Advantages

1. **Zero Maintenance**: No manual tracking files
2. **Accurate**: Git history is the source of truth
3. **Automatic**: Labels appear and expire automatically
4. **Consistent**: No human error in labeling
5. **Intuitive**: Time-based logic is easy to understand
