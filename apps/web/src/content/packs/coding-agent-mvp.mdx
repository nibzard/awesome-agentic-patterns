## Overview

This pack provides the foundational patterns needed to build a functional AI coding agent. It combines specification-driven development with safe execution patterns to create an agent that can write and modify code while maintaining human oversight.

## When to Use This Pack

- **Building your first coding agent**: Start here if you're new to AI agent development
- **Internal tools**: Create coding assistants for your team's specific workflows
- **Prototyping**: Quickly validate AI coding capabilities for your use case
- **Learning**: Understand the core patterns that power more complex coding agents

## Patterns Included

### 1. Specification-Driven Agent Development
The foundation of reliable coding agents. By defining clear specifications upfront, the agent can work towards well-defined goals rather than improvising.

**Why it's essential**: Prevents scope creep and ensures the agent understands what it's building.

### 2. Code-Then-Execute Pattern
Separates code generation from execution, allowing for review and validation before running any code.

**Why it's essential**: Provides a safety buffer and enables human-in-the-loop workflows.

### 3. Human-in-Loop Approval Framework
Requires human approval for potentially risky operations like file modifications or external API calls.

**Why it's essential**: Critical for building trust and preventing unintended consequences.

### 4. LLM Observability
Gives visibility into the agent's reasoning, decisions, and operations.

**Why it's essential**: Essential for debugging, understanding agent behavior, and building trust.

## Implementation Considerations

### Start Simple
Begin with read-only operations and gradually add write permissions as you build confidence in the agent.

### Clear Communication
Ensure your agent clearly communicates what it's doing and why, especially when requesting human approval.

### Iterative Improvement
Use observability data to identify common failure modes and refine your agent's behavior over time.

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered these patterns, consider:
- Adding **Reflection** for self-correction
- Implementing **Asynchronous Coding Agent Pipeline** for parallel work
- Exploring **Tool Use Incentivization via Reward Shaping** for complex tasks
