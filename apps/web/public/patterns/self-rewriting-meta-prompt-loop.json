Manually editing them is slow and error-prone.\n\n## Solution\nLet the agent **rewrite its own system prompt** after each interaction:\n\n1. **Reflect** on the latest dialogue or episode.  \n2. Draft improvements to the instructions (add heuristics, refine tool advice, retire bad rules).  \n3. **Validate** the draft (internal sanity-check or external gate).  \n4. Replace the old system prompt with the revised version; persist in version control.  \n5. Use the new prompt on the next episode, closing the self-improvement loop.\n\n```python\n# pseudo-code\ndialogue = run_episode()\ndelta = LLM(\"Reflect on dialogue and propose prompt edits\", dialogue)\nif passes_guardrails(delta):\n    system_prompt += delta\n    save(system_prompt)\n```\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n**Pros:** rapid adaptation; no human in the loop for minor tweaks.\n**Cons:** risk of drift or jailbreak—needs a strong guardrail step.\n\n## References\n\n* Goodman, *Meta-Prompt: A Simple Self-Improving Language Agent*.
