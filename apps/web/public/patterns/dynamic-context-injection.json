  "body": "\n## Problem\n\nWhile layered configuration files provide good baseline context, agents often need specific pieces of information (e.g., contents of a particular file, output of a script, predefined complex prompt) on-demand during an interactive session. Constantly editing static context files or pasting large chunks of text into prompts is inefficient.\n\n## Solution\n\nImplement mechanisms for users to dynamically inject context into the agent's working memory during a session. Common approaches include:\n\n- **File/Folder At-Mentions:** Allowing users to type a special character (e.g., `@`) followed by a file or folder path (e.g., `@src/components/Button.tsx` or `@app/tests/`). The agent then ingests the content of the specified file or a summary of the folder into its current context for the ongoing task.\n- **Custom Slash Commands:** Enabling users to define reusable, named prompts or instructions in separate files (e.g., in `~/.claude/commands/foo.md`). These can be invoked with a slash command (e.g., `/user:foo`), causing their content to be loaded into the agent's context. This is useful for frequently used complex instructions or context snippets.\n\nThese methods allow for a more fluid and efficient way to provide targeted context exactly when needed.\n\n## Example (context injection flow)\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Agent\n    participant FS as File System\n    participant Commands as Command Store\n\n    User->>Agent: Working on task...\n    User->>Agent: @src/components/Button.tsx\n    Agent->>FS: Read Button.tsx\n    FS-->>Agent: File contents\n    Agent->>Agent: Inject into context\n\n    User->>Agent: /user:deployment\n    Agent->>Commands: Load ~/.claude/commands/deployment.md\n    Commands-->>Agent: Deployment instructions\n    Agent->>Agent: Inject into context\n\n    Agent-->>User: Continue with enriched context\n```\n\n## References\n- Based on the at-mention and slash command features described in \"Mastering Claude Code: Boris Cherny's Guide & Cheatsheet,\" section IV.\n\n[Source](https://www.nibzard.com/claude-code)"
