  "body": "\n## Problem\nWhen an agent rewrites its own \"constitution,\" it may accidentally violate safety or regress on alignment objectives if changes aren't reviewed.\n\n## Solution\nStore the constitution in a **version-controlled, signed repository**:\n\n- YAML/TOML rules live in Git.  \n- Each commit is signed (e.g., Sigstore); CI runs automated policy checks.  \n- Only commits signed by approved reviewers or automated tests are merged.  \n- The agent can *propose* changes, but a gatekeeper merges them.\n\n## How to use it\n- Require `git commit -S` or similar.  \n- Run diff-based linting to flag deletions of critical rules.  \n- Expose constitution `HEAD` as read-only context in every agent episode.\n\n## References\n- Hiveism, *Self-Alignment by Constitutional AI*\n- Anthropic, *Constitutional AI* white-paper"
