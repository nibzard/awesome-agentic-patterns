  "body": "\n## Problem\nMany individuals in non-software engineering roles (e.g., sales, marketing, operations, communications) could benefit from custom software tools, scripts, or dashboards tailored to their specific workflows, but lack the traditional programming skills to build them.\n\n## Solution\nEmpower a broader range of users, including those without deep coding expertise, to create or modify software solutions for their own needs using AI agents. With an AI agent as an assistant, these users can:\n1.  Describe their desired tool or functionality in natural language.\n2.  Have the agent generate the necessary code (e.g., for a dashboard, a script to automate a task, a simple web application).\n3.  Iteratively refine the tool with the agent's help.\n4.  Even perform simple bug fixes or modifications to existing tools or codebases.\n\nThis pattern lowers the barrier to software creation, allowing domain experts in various fields to build their own productivity tools, thereby \"democratizing\" software development to some extent.\n\n## Example\nA sales team member uses an AI agent to create a custom dashboard that pulls data from multiple sources to track their specific KPIs, without needing to write complex SQL or frontend code themselves. Or a communications team member uses an agent to fix a small bug on a company webpage.\n\n## References\n- Jacob Jackson (Cursor) at 0:27:52: \"...you're going to see people building software, people in organizational functions building software who were not previously building software. You know, like people in sales who would not have built their own tools before will now be building, for example, dashboards to track what's important to them...\"\n- Alex Albert (Anthropic) at 0:28:10, referencing a comms team member: \"...he's actually been like shipping bug fixes to claude.ai... he pops in with like a PR and he's like asking for a stamp.\""
