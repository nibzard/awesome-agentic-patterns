  "body": "\n## Problem\nAI agents, especially those using complex models or multiple tools, can sometimes behave like \"black boxes.\" Users may not understand why an agent made a particular decision, chose a specific tool, or generated a certain output. This lack of transparency can hinder debugging, trust, and the ability to effectively guide the agent.\n\n## Solution\nImplement a feature that allows users to inspect the agent's internal \"thought process\" or reasoning steps on demand. This could be triggered by a keybinding (e.g., `Ctrl+R` in Claude Code) or a command.\n\nWhen activated, the verbose output might reveal:\n\n-   The agent's interpretation of the user's prompt.\n-   Alternative actions or tools it considered.\n-   The specific tool(s) it selected and why (if available).\n-   Intermediate steps or sub-tasks it performed.\n-   Confidence scores or internal states.\n-   Raw outputs from tools before they are processed or summarized.\n\nThis transparency helps users understand the agent's decision-making process, identify issues if the agent is stuck or producing incorrect results, and learn how to prompt more effectively.\n\n## Example (transparency activation)\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Agent\n    participant UI as Interface\n\n    User->>Agent: Complex task request\n    Agent->>Agent: Process internally\n    Agent-->>User: Standard output\n\n    User->>UI: Ctrl+R (or verbose command)\n    UI->>Agent: Request verbose details\n    Agent-->>UI: Internal reasoning steps\n    Agent-->>UI: Tool selection rationale\n    Agent-->>UI: Confidence scores\n    Agent-->>UI: Raw tool outputs\n    UI-->>User: Detailed transparency view\n```\n\n## References\n-   Based on the `Ctrl+R` keybinding for showing verbose output in \"Mastering Claude Code: Boris Cherny's Guide & Cheatsheet,\" section V.\n\n[Source](https://www.nibzard.com/claude-code)\n"
