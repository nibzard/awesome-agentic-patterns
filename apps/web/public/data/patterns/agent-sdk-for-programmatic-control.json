  "body": "\n## Problem\nInteractive terminal or chat interfaces are suitable for many agent tasks, but not for all. Integrating agent capabilities into automated workflows (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, scheduled jobs, batch processing) or building more complex applications on top of core agent functionalities requires a programmatic interface.\n\n## Solution\nProvide a Software Development Kit (SDK) that exposes the agent's core functionalities for programmatic access. This SDK allows developers to:\n\n-   Invoke agent actions (e.g., process a prompt, use a tool, access memory) from code (e.g., Python, TypeScript).\n-   Configure agent behavior and tool access in a non-interactive manner.\n-   Integrate agent logic into larger software systems.\n-   Automate repetitive tasks that involve the agent.\n-   Build custom user interfaces or applications powered by the agent's backend.\n\nThe SDK typically includes libraries, command-line interfaces (CLIs) for scripting, and documentation for headless or embedded use of the agent.\n\n## Example (SDK integration)\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Application/Script] --> B[Agent SDK]\n    B --> C[Agent Core]\n\n    B --> D[CLI Interface]\n    B --> E[Python Library]\n    B --> F[TypeScript Library]\n\n    C --> G[Tool Access]\n    C --> H[Memory Management]\n    C --> I[Model Interface]\n\n    G --> J[File System]\n    G --> K[Web API]\n    G --> L[Custom Tools]\n```\n\n## Example CLI Usage (Conceptual, from Claude Code SDK info):\n```bash\n$ claude -p \"what did i do this week?\" \\\n  --allowedTools Bash(git log:*) \\\n  --output-format json\n```\n\n## References\n-   Based on the description of the Claude Code SDK in \"Mastering Claude Code: Boris Cherny's Guide & Cheatsheet,\" section VI.\n\n[Source](https://www.nibzard.com/claude-code)\n"
