  "body": "\n## Problem\n\nAn internal agent only provides value when its workflows are initiated. Building out a library of workflow initialization mechanisms (triggers) is core to agent adoption. Without easy triggers, employees can't effectively automate their day-to-day workflows.\n\n## Solution\n\nImplement **multi-platform webhook triggers** that allow external SaaS tools to initiate agent workflows automatically.\n\n**Trigger types implemented:**\n\n1. **Notion webhooks**: Fire on page/database modifications\n   - Document status changes (draft → \"ready for review\")\n   - Request for Comment (RFC) workflows\n   - Auto-assign reviewers based on topic\n   - In-line commenting with suggestions\n\n2. **Slack messages**: Bot responds in channels\n   - Public channel responses\n   - Private channel support (with careful logging)\n   - Channel creation triggers for auto-joining\n   - Default prompts for new channels (respond only when mentioned)\n\n3. **Jira webhooks**: Issue lifecycle events\n   - Issue creation, updates, comments\n   - Custom routing logic for ticket assignment\n\n4. **Slack reacji (emoji reactions)**: Quick workflow initiation\n   - Listen for specific emojis in any channel\n   - Example: `:jira:` reaction turns thread into ticket\n   - Centralized routing instructions\n\n5. **Scheduled events**: Periodic triggers\n   - Slack workflows publishing to channels\n   - GitHub Actions cron jobs\n\n```pseudo\n# Trigger flow\nPlatform Event → Webhook → Agent Trigger → Workflow Execution\n```\n\n## How to use it\n\n**Implementation considerations:**\n\n**Authentication and authorization:**\n- OAuth2 tokens + SSL where possible\n- Platform-specific security (Slack request verification)\n- No authorization tokens for platforms that don't support it\n\n**Private channel security:**\n```yaml\nslack_private_channels:\n  auto_join: false  # Don't auto-join private channels\n  logging:\n    # Critical: Don't log evidence of private channel activity\n    exclude_private_channels: true\n    # Exfiltrating private messages loses trust instantly\n```\n\n**Trigger configuration:**\n\n```yaml\n# Notion triggers\nnotion_triggers:\n  - database: \"RFC Database\"\n    event: \"page_updated\"\n    filter: \"status.draft → status.ready_for_review\"\n    workflow: \"assign_reviewers\"\n\n  - database: \"Documentation\"\n    event: \"page_created\"\n    workflow: \"suggest_improvements\"\n\n# Slack reacji triggers\nslack_reacji:\n  - emoji: \":jira:\"\n    scope: \"any_channel\"\n    workflow: \"thread_to_ticket\"\n    routing: \"centralized\"\n\n# Scheduled triggers\nscheduled_triggers:\n  - cron: \"0 9 * * MON\"\n    workflow: \"weekly_standup_prep\"\n    via: \"github_actions\"\n```\n\n**Why not Zapier/n8n?**\n\nThe author chose custom implementation over existing automation platforms:\n\n- **Full control**: Quality details facilitate adoption better than generic integration constraints\n- **Nuanced behavior**: Custom handling of entity resolution, error cases\n- **Learning**: Building internal intuition about agents\n- **Compatibility**: Can still use Zapier via generic webhook catch-all\n\n**Generic webhook catch-all:**\n\n```yaml\n# Fallback for esoteric platforms\ngeneric_webhook:\n  endpoint: \"/webhooks/generic\"\n  behavior: \"include_full_message_in_context\"\n  integration: \"can_pair_with_zapier\"\n```\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- **Low friction**: Easy workflow initiation enables iterative learning\n- **Platform-native**: Users work in existing tools (Slack, Notion, Jira)\n- **Reactive**: Agent responds to events, not just explicit requests\n- **Flexible**: Support for custom routing and nuanced workflows\n- **Scalable**: Easy to add new trigger types by pasting docs to LLM\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- **Maintenance overhead**: Each platform integration requires ongoing work\n- **Security complexity**: Private channels, auth tokens, request verification\n- **Platform lock-in**: Deep integration with specific tools\n- **Observability challenges**: Must avoid logging sensitive data\n- **Custom vs off-the-shelf**: Building vs buying (Zapier, n8n)\n\n**Quality details matter:**\n\n> \"The quality details facilitate adoption in a way that Zapier integration's constraints simply do not.\"\n\nCustom implementation allows nuances like:\n- Slack entity resolution for seamless experience\n- Careful logging behavior in private channels\n- Centralized ticket routing logic\n\n**When to use:**\n\n- Internal agent platforms with multiple integration points\n- Teams already using Slack, Notion, Jira extensively\n- Document-heavy workflows (RFCs, reviews, approvals)\n- Need for automated routing and triage\n\n**When to use Zapier/n8n instead:**\n\n- Esoteric one-off integrations\n- Rapid prototyping before custom implementation\n- Non-technical users who need self-service\n\n## References\n\n* [Building an internal agent: Triggers](https://lethain.com/agents-triggers/) - Will Larson (2025)\n* Related: [Proactive Trigger Vocabulary](proactive-trigger-vocabulary.md) - Natural language trigger phrases for skill routing\n"
