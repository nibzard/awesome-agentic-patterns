  "body": "\n## Problem\nModels like Claude Sonnet 4.5 exhibit \"context anxiety\"—they become aware of approaching context window limits and proactively summarize progress or make decisive moves to close tasks, even when sufficient context remains. This leads to:\n\n- Premature task completion and shortcuts\n- Incomplete work despite having adequate context\n- Underestimation of remaining token capacity (consistently incorrect estimates)\n- Self-imposed pressure to \"wrap up\" rather than continue working\n\n## Solution\nImplement strategic context budget management and aggressive prompting techniques to override anxiety-driven behaviors:\n\n**1. Context Buffer Strategy**\n- Enable larger context windows (e.g., 1M token beta) but cap actual usage at 200k tokens\n- Provides psychological \"runway\" that mitigates the model's anxiety about running out of space\n\n**2. Aggressive Counter-Prompting**\n- Add explicit reminders at conversation start: \"You have plenty of context remaining—do not rush to complete tasks\"\n- Include end-of-conversation reinforcement: \"Take your time, context is not a constraint\"\n- Override summarization impulses with direct instructions\n\n**3. Token Budget Transparency**\n- Explicitly state available token budget in prompts\n- Provide regular reassurance about remaining capacity\n- Counter the model's tendency to underestimate available space\n\n```pseudo\n# Context anxiety mitigation approach\ndef setup_context_anxiety_management():\n    context_buffer = enable_large_context(1M_tokens)\n    actual_limit = cap_usage_at(200k_tokens)\n    \n    prompt_prefix = \"\"\"\n    CONTEXT GUIDANCE: You have abundant context space (200k+ tokens available).\n    Do NOT rush to complete tasks or summarize prematurely.\n    Work thoroughly and completely on each step.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    prompt_suffix = \"\"\"\n    Remember: Context is NOT a constraint. Take your time and be thorough.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    return enhanced_prompt(prefix + user_input + suffix)\n```\n\n## How to use it\nApply when using models that exhibit context awareness and anxiety behaviors:\n\n- **Development Work**: Long coding sessions where premature completion hurts quality\n- **Research Tasks**: Multi-step analysis requiring sustained attention\n- **Complex Planning**: Tasks needing thorough exploration before conclusions\n\nMonitor for signs of context anxiety: sudden summarization, rushed decisions, or explicit mentions of \"running out of space.\"\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n* **Pros:** Prevents premature task abandonment; enables more thorough work; overcomes model-specific behavioral quirks\n* **Cons:** Requires model-specific tuning; may increase actual token usage; aggressive prompting adds overhead\n\n## References\n* [Cognition AI: Devin & Claude Sonnet 4.5 - Lessons and Challenges](https://cognition.ai/blog/devin-sonnet-4-5-lessons-and-challenges)\n"
