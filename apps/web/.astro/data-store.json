This guide will help you navigate the pattern catalogue and make informed decisions about which patterns to use.\n\n## Start with Your Use Case\n\nBefore diving into patterns, clearly define your use case:\n\n1. **What type of agent are you building?**\n   - Fully autonomous agent\n   - Human-assisted agent\n   - Workflow automation\n   - Coding assistant\n   - Research assistant\n\n2. **What's the complexity level?**\n   - Simple, well-defined tasks\n   - Moderately complex with some decision points\n   - Highly complex requiring planning and reasoning\n\n3. **What are your constraints?**\n   - Safety requirements\n   - Performance needs\n   - Resource limitations\n   - Integration requirements\n\n## Use the Decision Tree\n\nOur interactive [Decision Tree](/decision) can help you find relevant patterns based on your answers to key questions. It's a great starting point for discovering patterns that match your use case.\n\n## Core Patterns to Consider\n\n### For Most Agents\n\nThese patterns are foundational and apply to almost any AI agent:\n\n- **Reflection**: Enables self-correction and improvement\n- **LLM Observability**: Provides visibility into agent behavior\n- **Specification-Driven Development**: Ensures clear goals and requirements\n\n### For Coding Agents\n\nIf you're building a coding assistant or developer tool:\n\n- **Code-Then-Execute Pattern**: Separates code generation from execution\n- **Human-in-Loop Approval**: Adds safety for code modifications\n- **Asynchronous Coding Agent Pipeline**: Enables parallel work\n\n### For Autonomous Agents\n\nFor agents that operate independently:\n\n- **Continuous Autonomous Task Loop**: Manages ongoing operation\n- **Episodic Memory**: Enables learning from past experiences\n- **Progressive Autonomy**: Gradually increases agent independence\n\n### For Safety-Critical Applications\n\nWhen mistakes could cause serious damage:\n\n- **Anti-Reward Hacking Grader Design**: Prevents gaming of reward systems\n- **Egress Lockdown**: Controls data exfiltration\n- **Deterministic Security Scanning**: Catches security issues early\n\n## Combining Patterns\n\nPatterns work best in combination. Consider these synergies:\n\n### **Coding Agent Stack**\n- Specification-Driven Development\n- Code-Then-Execute\n- Human-in-Loop Approval\n- LLM Observability\n\n### **Autonomous Research Agent**\n- Continuous Autonomous Task Loop\n- Reflection\n- Episodic Memory\n- Tool Use Incentivization\n\n### **Safety-First System**\n- Anti-Reward Hacking\n- Egress Lockdown\n- Human-in-Loop Approval\n- Deterministic Security Scanning\n\n## Iterative Approach\n\nDon't try to implement everything at once:\n\n1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 2-3 core patterns\n2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate that patterns work together\n3. **Add Gradually**: Introduce additional patterns as needed\n4. **Measure Impact**: Evaluate each pattern's contribution\n\n## Learn from Others\n\nExplore our [Pattern Packs](/packs) to see curated combinations of patterns for specific use cases.

It combines specification-driven development with safe execution patterns to create an agent that can write and modify code while maintaining human oversight.\n\n## When to Use This Pack\n\n- **Building your first coding agent**: Start here if you're new to AI agent development\n- **Internal tools**: Create coding assistants for your team's specific workflows\n- **Prototyping**: Quickly validate AI coding capabilities for your use case\n- **Learning**: Understand the core patterns that power more complex coding agents\n\n## Patterns Included\n\n### 1. Specification-Driven Agent Development\nThe foundation of reliable coding agents. By defining clear specifications upfront, the agent can work towards well-defined goals rather than improvising.\n\n**Why it's essential**: Prevents scope creep and ensures the agent understands what it's building.\n\n### 2. Code-Then-Execute Pattern\nSeparates code generation from execution, allowing for review and validation before running any code.\n\n**Why it's essential**: Provides a safety buffer and enables human-in-the-loop workflows.\n\n### 3. Human-in-Loop Approval Framework\nRequires human approval for potentially risky operations like file modifications or external API calls.\n\n**Why it's essential**: Critical for building trust and preventing unintended consequences.\n\n### 4. LLM Observability\nGives visibility into the agent's reasoning, decisions, and operations.\n\n**Why it's essential**: Essential for debugging, understanding agent behavior, and building trust.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n### Start Simple\nBegin with read-only operations and gradually add write permissions as you build confidence in the agent.\n\n### Clear Communication\nEnsure your agent clearly communicates what it's doing and why, especially when requesting human approval.\n\n### Iterative Improvement\nUse observability data to identify common failure modes and refine your agent's behavior over time.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce you've mastered these patterns, consider:\n- Adding **Reflection** for self-correction\n- Implementing **Asynchronous Coding Agent Pipeline** for parallel work\n- Exploring **Tool Use Incentivization via Reward Shaping** for complex tasks","src/content/packs/coding-agent-mvp.mdx","697c7a90712de780","coding-agent-mvp.mdx","safety-first-stack",{"id":49,"data":51,"body":60,"filePath":61,"digest":62,"legacyId":63,"deferredRender":21},{"title":52,"summary":53,"domain":54,"patterns":55,"order":16},"Safety-First Stack","Security-critical patterns for building AI agents that operate safely in production environments.","Security & Safety",[56,57,58,59,43],"anti-reward-hacking-grader-design","egress-lockdown-no-exfiltration-channel","lethal-trifecta-threat-model","deterministic-security-scanning-build-loop","## Overview\n\nThis pack combines the most critical security patterns for building AI agents that can be safely deployed in production. It addresses the three major threat vectors: reward hacking, data exfiltration, and unintended actions.\n\n## When to Use This Pack\n\n- **Production deployments**: When your agent will operate in sensitive environments\n- **Handling sensitive data**: When working with PII, financial data, or confidential information\n- **High-stakes decisions**: When agent errors could cause significant damage\n- **Regulatory compliance**: When you need to meet security or compliance requirements\n\n## Patterns Included\n\n### 1. Anti-Reward Hacking Grader Design\nPrevents agents from gaming their reward systems by implementing robust evaluation mechanisms.\n\n**Why it's essential**: Reward hacking is one of the most common failure modes in RL-based agents.\n\n### 2. Egress Lockdown: No Exfiltration Channel\nEliminates unauthorized data exfiltration by controlling all outbound communications.\n\n**Why it's essential**: Critical for preventing data leaks in environments with sensitive information.\n\n### 3. Lethal Trifecta Threat Model\nAddresses the three critical failure modes: reward hacking, goal misgeneralization, and scalable oversight.\n\n**Why it's essential**: Provides a comprehensive framework for thinking about AI safety.\n\n### 4. Deterministic Security Scanning Build Loop\nIntegrates security checks into the agent's development and deployment pipeline.\n\n**Why it's essential**: Catches security issues before they reach production.\n\n### 5. Human-in-Loop Approval Framework\nRequires human approval for potentially dangerous operations.\n\n**Why it's essential**: The final safety net for preventing catastrophic errors.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n### Defense in Depth\nLayer multiple security patterns so that if one fails, others provide protection.\n\n### Monitoring and Alerting\nImplement comprehensive logging and alerting for all security-relevant events.\n\n### Regular Audits\nConduct regular security audits of your agent's behavior and the systems it interacts with.\n\n### Incident Response\nHave clear procedures for responding to security incidents, including agent shutdown mechanisms.\n\n## Threat Modeling\n\nBefore deployment, consider:\n- **What could go wrong?** Brainstorm failure modes and attack vectors\n- **What's the blast radius?** Limit potential damage from agent errors\n- **How would we know?** Implement detection and monitoring\n- **How do we recover?** Plan rollback and recovery procedures\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter implementing these patterns:\n- Consider **Workflow Evals with Mocked Tools** for comprehensive testing\n- Explore **PII Tokenization** for data protection\n- Add **Proactive Agent State Externalization** for audit trails","src/content/packs/safety-first-stack.mdx","1330b88fe940fd18","safety-first-stack.mdx"]
