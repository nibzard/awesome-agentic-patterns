## Problem
Agents that rely on ad-hoc heuristics explore poorly, wasting tokens and API calls on dead ends.

## Solution
Embed a *fully specified* RL algorithm—Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning (PSRL)—inside the LLM's reasoning:

- Maintain a Bayesian posterior over task models.  
- Sample a model, compute an optimal plan/policy, execute, observe reward, update posterior.  
- Express each step in natural language so the core LLM can carry it out with tool calls.

## How to use it
Wrap the algorithm in a reusable prompt template or code skeleton the LLM can fill.
