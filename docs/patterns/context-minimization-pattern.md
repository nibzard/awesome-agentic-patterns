## Problem
User-supplied or tainted text lingers in the conversation, enabling it to influence later generations.

## Solution
**Purge or redact** untrusted segments once they've served their purpose:

- After transforming input into a safe intermediate (query, structured object), strip the original prompt from context.  
- Subsequent reasoning sees **only trusted data**, eliminating latent injections.

```pseudo
sql = LLM("to SQL", user_prompt)
remove(user_prompt)              # tainted tokens gone
rows = db.query(sql)
answer = LLM("summarize rows", rows)
```

## How to use it

Customer-service chat, medical Q&A, any multi-turn flow where initial text shouldn't steer later steps.

## Trade-offs

* **Pros:** Simple; no extra models needed; helps prevent [context window anxiety](context-window-anxiety-management.md) by reducing overall context usage.
* **Cons:** Later turns lose conversational nuance; may hurt UX; overly aggressive minimization can remove useful context.
