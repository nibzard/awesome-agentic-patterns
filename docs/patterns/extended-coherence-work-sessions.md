## Problem
Early AI agents and models often suffered from a short "coherence window," meaning they could only maintain focus and context for a few minutes before their performance degraded significantly (e.g., losing track of instructions, generating irrelevant output). This limited their utility for complex, multi-stage tasks that require sustained effort over hours.

## Solution
Utilize AI models and agent architectures that are specifically designed or have demonstrably improved capabilities to maintain coherence over extended periods (e.g., several hours). This involves:
- Leveraging newer foundation models with larger context windows and better long-term memory.
- Implementing agentic architectures that can manage state and context effectively over time.
- Prioritizing this capability allows agents to undertake substantial projects, engage in prolonged problem-solving, and complete tasks that were previously infeasible due to coherence limitations.

The goal is to enable agents to work on tasks for as long as a human counterpart might, without a degradation in the quality or relevance of their work.
