## Problem
Injecting a single poisoned document can manipulate global reasoning if all data is processed in one context.

## Solution
Adopt a **map-reduce workflow**:

- **Map:** Spawn lightweight, *sandboxed* LLMs—each ingests one untrusted chunk and emits a constrained output (boolean, JSON schema, etc.).  
- **Reduce:** Aggregate those safe summaries with either deterministic code or a privileged LLM that sees only sanitized fields.

```pseudo
results = []
for doc in docs:
    ok = SandboxLLM("Is this an invoice? (yes/no)", doc)
    results.append(ok)
final = reduce(results)  # no raw docs enter this step
```

## How to use it

File triage, product-review summarizers, resume filters—any N-to-1 decision where each item's influence should stay local.

## Trade-offs

* **Pros:** A malicious item can't taint others; scalable parallelism.
* **Cons:** Requires strict output validation; extra orchestration overhead.
