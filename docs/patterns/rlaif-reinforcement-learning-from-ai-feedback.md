## Problem

Traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) requires extensive human annotation for preference data, which is expensive (often $1+ per annotation), time-consuming, and difficult to scale. This creates a bottleneck in training aligned AI systems, especially when dealing with complex or specialized domains where human expertise is scarce or costly.

## Solution

RLAIF uses AI models themselves to generate preference feedback and evaluation data, dramatically reducing costs to less than $0.01 per annotation while maintaining or improving quality. The approach involves:

1. **AI-Generated Critiques**: Use a language model to evaluate outputs based on a set of principles or constitution
2. **Preference Data Generation**: Have the AI model compare pairs of responses and select the better one according to specified criteria
3. **Synthetic Training Data**: Generate high-quality training examples using the AI's own capabilities
4. **Constitutional Principles**: Guide the feedback process with explicit rules rather than implicit human preferences

This technique forms the foundation of Constitutional AI and has become a default method in post-training and RLHF literature.

## Example

```python
class RLAIFAgent:
    def __init__(self, base_model, critic_model, constitution):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.critic_model = critic_model
        self.constitution = constitution  # List of principles
    
    def generate_critique(self, prompt, response):
        critique_prompt = f"""
        Evaluate the following response according to these principles:
        {self.constitution}
        
        Prompt: {prompt}
        Response: {response}
        
        Provide specific feedback on:
        1. Adherence to principles
        2. Quality of response
        3. Suggested improvements
        """
        return self.critic_model.generate(critique_prompt)
    
    def generate_preference_data(self, prompt, response_a, response_b):
        comparison_prompt = f"""
        Given these principles: {self.constitution}
        
        Which response is better for the prompt: "{prompt}"
        
        Response A: {response_a}
        Response B: {response_b}
        
        Choose A or B and explain why according to the principles.
        """
        preference = self.critic_model.generate(comparison_prompt)
        return self.parse_preference(preference)
    
    def improve_response(self, prompt, initial_response, critique):
        improvement_prompt = f"""
        Original prompt: {prompt}
        Initial response: {initial_response}
        Critique: {critique}
        
        Generate an improved response addressing the critique.
        """
        return self.base_model.generate(improvement_prompt)
```

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- **Cost Efficiency**: 100x cheaper than human feedback ($0.01 vs $1+)
- **Scalability**: Can generate unlimited feedback data without human bottlenecks
- **Consistency**: AI feedback is more consistent than varying human annotators
- **Speed**: Near-instantaneous feedback generation

**Cons:**
- **Bias Amplification**: May reinforce existing model biases
- **Limited Novelty**: Cannot provide truly novel insights beyond model's training
- **Quality Variance**: Feedback quality depends on the critic model's capabilities
- **Principle Design**: Requires careful crafting of constitutional principles
