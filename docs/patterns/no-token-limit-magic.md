## Problem
Aggressive prompt compression to save tokens stifles reasoning depth and self-correction.

## Solution
During prototyping, **remove hard token limits**. Allow lavish context and multiple reasoning passes. Yes, it's pricierâ€”but dramatically better outputs surface valuable patterns before optimizing.
