## Quick steps

1. Create a new file in `patterns/` using kebab-case.
2. Copy the template from [`TEMPLATE.md`](https://github.com/nibzard/awesome-agentic-patterns/blob/main/TEMPLATE.md).
3. Open a PR titled `Add: pattern-name`.

## Pattern Schema

All patterns must follow the schema defined in [`SCHEMA.md`](SCHEMA.md). This includes:

- Required front matter fields
- Optional front matter fields
- Required body sections
- Optional body sections

### Required Front Matter

Every pattern MUST include these fields:

```yaml
---
title: "Pattern Title Here"
status: emerging  # proposed, emerging, established, validated-in-production, best-practice, experimental-but-awesome, rapidly-improving
authors: ["Contributor Name (@username)"]
category: "Feedback Loops"  # See SCHEMA.md for all categories
source: "https://example.com/reference"
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

### Optional Front Matter

These fields MAY be added to provide additional context:

```yaml
---
based_on: ["Original Creator (Source)"]
summary: "One-sentence description of the pattern"
slug: "pattern-slug"  # Auto-generated from title if omitted
maturity: "maturing"  # early, maturing, mature
complexity: "medium"  # low, medium, high
effort: "days"  # hours, days, weeks
impact: "high"  # low, medium, high
signals: ["When this pattern helps"]
anti_signals: ["When it is a bad fit"]
prerequisites: ["Prereq 1", "Prereq 2"]
related: ["other-pattern-id"]
anti_patterns: ["opposing-pattern-id"]
tools: ["tool-type-1", "tool-type-2"]
domains: ["coding", "research", "ops"]
updated_at: "2025-01-13"

```

See [`SCHEMA.md`](SCHEMA.md) for complete field definitions and enum values.

## Rules

* One pattern per PR.
* Keep the pattern concise (max ~200 lines) and backed by a public reference.
* Fill in all required front matter fields.
* Include all required body sections: Problem, Solution, How to use it, Trade-offs, References.
* Do not edit README sections between the AUTO-GENERATED markers.
* `docs/` is generated by `make site_link` and should not be edited by hand.
* Check spelling/grammar and remove trailing whitespace.

## Optional local checks

* `make lint_front_matter`
* `python scripts/build_readme.py`

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait until someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**
