# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Quick steps

1. Create a new file in `patterns/` using kebab-case.
2. Copy the template from [`TEMPLATE.md`](https://github.com/nibzard/awesome-agentic-patterns/blob/main/TEMPLATE.md).
3. Open a PR titled `Add: pattern-name`.

## Rules

* One pattern per PR.
* Keep the pattern concise (max ~200 lines) and backed by a public reference.
* Fill in front-matter: `title`, `status`, `category`, `tags`, plus `authors`, `based_on`, `source` when available.
* Do not edit README sections between the AUTO-GENERATED markers.
* `docs/` is generated by `make site_link` and should not be edited by hand.
* Check spelling/grammar and remove trailing whitespace.

## Optional local checks

* `make lint_front_matter`
* `python scripts/build_readme.py`

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait until someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**
